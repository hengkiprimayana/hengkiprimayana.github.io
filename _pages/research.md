Currently Focuses on Research about Elementary Education. I’m also passionate about educational technology, Education Policy, Teacher Education and Professional Development of Educators, Primary Education, Physical Education and Development Curriculum and Pedagogy, Education Assessment and Evaluation.

I’ve put together all my activities on this website to highlight my research and publication interests. If you’re interested in my research, please feel free to get in touch. I’m always interested in collaborations and future funding opportunities.
